### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcus, a computing student studying in Malaysia.

I love to code and join local tech communities.

These are some of the group projects completed during my course:

- **E-Commerce Website** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL
- **Ticket Selling System** - Java
- **F&B Website** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Point of Sales System** - C

These are some of the content or materials prepared for workshops:

- **WebLaunch 2020 HTML Workshop by Sunway Tech Club** - HTML

All of the repos can be found in my GitHub.
